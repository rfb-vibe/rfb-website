This lab from Flatiron School is a culmination of the lessons on importing, cleaning up, analyzing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data using pandas to explore housing data from Ames, IA.

<!--more--> 

### Objectives of this Lab

Be able to:

* Practice loading data with pandas
* Practice calculating measures of centrality and dispersion with pandas
* Practice creating subsets of data with pandas
* Practice using data visualizations to explore data, and interpreting those visualizations
* Perform a full exploratory data analysis process to gain insight about a dataset 

### Data Understanding

Each record (row) in this dataset represents a home that was sold in Ames, IA.

Each feature (column) in this dataset is some attribute of that home sale. You can view the file `data/data_description.txt` in this repository for a full explanation of all variables in this dataset â€” 80 columns in total.

We are going to focus on the following features:

**SalePrice**: `Sale price of the house in dollars`

**TotRmsAbvGrd**: `Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)`

**OverallCond**: `Rates the overall condition of the house`
```
       10	Very Excellent
       9	 Excellent
       8	 Very Good
       7	 Good
       6	 Above Average	
       5	 Average
       4	 Below Average	
       3	 Fair
       2	 Poor
       1	 Very Poor
```

**YrSold**: `Year Sold (YYYY)`

**YearBuilt**: `Original construction date`

**LandSlope**: `Slope of property`
```
       Gtl	Gentle slope
       Mod	Moderate Slope	
       Sev	Severe Slope
```

### The Tasks
#### 1. Load the Dataset with Pandas

Import pandas with the standard alias `pd` and load the data into a dataframe with the standard name `df`.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv('data/ames.csv', index_col = 0)
# index_col set to 0 to avoid creating an extra Id column

```


#### 2. Explore Data Distributions

Produce summary statistics, visualizations, and interpretive text describing the distributions of `SalePrice`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, and `OverallCond`.

**Sale Price**
```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Create an object that is a list of the sale prices
sp = df['SalePrice']
# Create an object that is the mean of the list of sale prices
sp.mean = df['SalePrice'].mean()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))
ax.hist(sp, bins = "auto", alpha = 0.7)
ax.axvline(sp.mean, color = "black")
ax.set_xlabel('Sale Price');
ax.set_ylabel('Number of Houses')
ax.set_title('Distribution of Sale Prices');

```


```{python, eval=FALSE}

print("The mean is:", sp.mean)
print("The median is:", df['SalePrice'].median())
print("The standard deviation is:", df['SalePrice'].std())

```

The mean is: 180921.20
The median is: 163000.0
The standard deviation is: 79442.50

The distribution of the sale prices is left-skewed with its mean sale price of $180,900 and median sale price of $163,000. There seem to be some significant outliers that are influencing the mean, so the median is helpful to know.

**Rooms Above Ground**
```{python, eval=FALSE}

# rag for 'Rooms Above Ground'
rag = df['TotRmsAbvGrd']
rag.mean = df['TotRmsAbvGrd'].mean()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))
ax.hist(rag, bins = "auto", alpha = 0.7)
ax.axvline(rag.mean, color = "black")
ax.set_xlabel('Numbers of Rooms Above Ground')
ax.set_ylabel('Number of Houses')
ax.set_title('Distribution of Rooms Above Ground');

```


```{python, eval=FALSE}

print("The mean is:", rag.mean)
print("The median is:", df['TotRmsAbvGrd'].median())
print("The standard deviation is:", df['TotRmsAbvGrd'].std())

```

This looks like more of a normal distribution around the mean, with 6-7 rooms on average above ground.

**Overall Condition**
```{python, eval=FALSE}

overall = df['OverallCond']
overall.mean = df['OverallCond'].mean()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))
ax.hist(overall, bins = "auto", alpha = 0.7)
ax.axvline(overall.mean, color = "black")
ax.set_xlabel('Overall Condition');
ax.set_ylabel('Number of Houses')
ax.set_title('Distribution of Overall Condition');

```


```{python, eval=FALSE}

print("The mean is:", overall.mean)
print("The median is:", df['OverallCond'].median())
print("The standard deviation is:", df['OverallCond'].std())

```

The mean is: 5.58
The median is: 5.0
The standard deviation is: 1.11

The overall condition of the homes sold is normally distributed, though a 10-item scale isn't necessarily continuous, so a histogram might not have been the best choice to visualize this data.

That being said, the median condition of home sold is "Average," with some more homes being sold above average, thus bringing the mean up a bit.

#### 3. Explore Differences between Subsets

Separate the data into subsets based on `OverallCond`, then demonstrate how this split impacts the distribution of `SalePrice`.

To do, we're going to create three variables, each of which represents a record-wise subset of `df` (meaning, it has the same columns as `df`, but only some of the rows).

* `below_average_condition`: home sales where the overall condition was less than 5
* `average_condition`: home sales where the overall condition was exactly 5
* `above_average_condition`: home sales where the overall condition was greater than 5

```{python, eval=FALSE}

below_average_condition = df[df['OverallCond'] < 5]
average_condition = df[df['OverallCond'] == 5]
above_average_condition = df[df['OverallCond'] > 5]

```


Then we'll plot of the distributions of sale price for each of these subsets.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Set up plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,5))

# Create custom bins so all are on the same scale
bins = range(df["SalePrice"].min(), df["SalePrice"].max(), int(df["SalePrice"].median()) // 20)

# Plot three histograms, with reduced opacity (alpha) so we
# can see them overlapping
ax.hist(
    x=above_average_condition["SalePrice"],
    label="above average condition",
    bins=bins,
    color="cyan",
    alpha=0.5
)
ax.hist(
    x=average_condition["SalePrice"],
    label="average condition",
    bins=bins,
    color="gray",
    alpha=0.3
)
ax.hist(
    x=below_average_condition["SalePrice"],
    label="below average condition",
    bins=bins,
    color="yellow",
    alpha=0.5
)

# Customize labels
ax.set_title("Distributions of Sale Price Grouped by Condition")
ax.set_xlabel("Sale Price")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Houses")
ax.legend();

```

It's pretty clear that fewer homes were sold if their condition were below average. What's more interesting to me is that the range of homes sold, both in number and price, seems greater for "average condition" than that of "above average." I suppose that maybe makes sense in terms of availability, but this visualization would give me pause if someone said that above average conditioned home sell more often and for more money than average homes.


#### 4. Explore Correlations

Find the features that have the strongest positive and negative correlations with `SalePrice`, and produce plots representing these relationships.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

correlation_series = df.corr()['SalePrice'].sort_values()

max_corr_value = correlation_series.iloc[-2]
max_corr_column = correlation_series.index[-2]
print("Most Positively Correlated Column:", max_corr_column)
print("Maximum Correlation Value:", max_corr_value)

```

Most Positively Correlated Column: OverallQual
Maximum Correlation Value: 0.79

```{python, eval=FALSE}

correlation_series = df.corr()['SalePrice'].sort_values()

min_corr_value = correlation_series.iloc[0]
min_corr_column = correlation_series.index[0]
print("Most Negatively Correlated Column:", min_corr_column)
print("Minimum Correlation Value:", min_corr_value)

```

Most Negatively Correlated Column: KitchenAbvGr
Minimum Correlation Value: -0.14

Now, we'll create a scatter plot of the relevant columns.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

import seaborn as sns

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(15,5))

# Plot distribution of column with highest correlation
sns.boxplot(
    x=df[max_corr_column],
    y=df["SalePrice"],
    ax=ax1
)
# Plot distribution of column with most negative correlation
sns.boxplot(
    x=df[min_corr_column],
    y=df["SalePrice"],
    ax=ax2
)

# Customize labels
ax1.set_title("Boxplot of Overall Condition with Sale Price")
ax1.set_xlabel("Overall Condition")
ax1.set_ylabel("Sale Price")
ax2.set_title("Boxplot of the Number of Kitchens Above Ground with Sale Price")
ax2.set_xlabel("Number of Kitchens Above Ground")
ax2.set_ylabel("Sale Price");

```

With regards to the boxplot of the overall condition of the home sold, there is a clear positive correlation, that as the overall condition improves from "Average" to "Good" to "Excellent", so too does the sale price - logic saying that the nicer the condition, the nicer the home, the more expensive the home. We also see more variance in sale price with as the overall condition improves, so there must be more in the data to explain that.

For the number of kitchens above ground, this seems like a silly correlation to highlight; while mathematically it may indicate the strongest negative correlation, what are additional factors that may be driving this other than just tbe number of kitchens above ground.

#### 5. Engineer and Explore a New Feature

What is the relationship between the year sold and the year built?

Create a new feature `Age`, which represents the difference between the year sold and the year built, and plot the relationship between the age and sale price.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Make a new column, Age
df["Age"] = df["YrSold"] - df["YearBuilt"]

# Set up plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,5))

# Plot Age vs. SalePrice
ax.scatter(df["Age"], df["SalePrice"], alpha=0.3, color="green")
ax.set_title("Home Age vs. Sale Price")
ax.set_xlabel("Age of Home at Time of Sale")
ax.set_ylabel("Sale Price");

```


Generally speaking, the newer the home, the more expensive the sale price. This could be associated with the overall condition of the home, so that would be an interesting factor to include in analysis.
