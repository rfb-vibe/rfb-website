I'm glad you're here. I am a data scientist, obsessed with solving challenging problems by exploring and analyzing large datasets. For six years, I worked in higher education where I conducted analysis of internal datasets to extract insights to drive program and service decision-making. Further, I defined measures of success, developed and communicated both findings and recommendations to non-technical audiences, and built self-service tools for ongoing monitoring of trends.

While my professional experience as a data scientist may be limited, I am well-versed in the technical programs and languages (Python / R) necessary to meet the expectations of all job responsibilities. I am excited by the challenge of solving problems using a wide array of modeling and quantitative techniques; my portfolio includes projects using multiple linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees and random forest classifiers, and ensemble methods like XGBoost.

I am deeply curious and comfortable solving unstructured business problems by exploring large datasets and keen to deliver meaningful insights and predictions about emerging trends to inform business solutions. I am obsessed with asking questions, researching, problem-solving, and presenting my findings.

I look forward to every opportunity to demonstrate my proficiency as a data scientist.
