Class notes on the normal distribution, standard normal distribution, central limit theorem, and confidence intervals.

## The Normal Distribution

The bell curve, the Gaussian curve - a continuous distribution that is symmetrical and its mean, median, and mode are equal. The area under the curve is 1.0

68% of values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean
95% of values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean
99.7% of values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean

**The Standard Normal Distribution**
A special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1

Any normal distribution can be converted to a standard normal distribution and vice versa using the equation:

$z$ = $x$ - \mu divided by \sigma

A z-score can help identify how many standard deviations above or below the mean a certain observation is - "above" or "below" the mean

**The Central Limit Theorem:** When you add a large number of independent random variables, irrespective of the original distribution of these variables, their sum tends towards a normal distribution.

## Confidence Intervals
A confidence interval is a range of values above and below the point estimate that captures the true population parameter at some predetermined confidence level.

If we want our confidence level — i.e., how confident we are that the true value of the parameter lies within the confidence interval — to be:
- **90%**: The z-score multiplier should be **z = 1.645**, because 90% of the area under the $Z \text{~} N(0, 1)$ normal distribution lies between -1.645 and 1.645.
- **95%**: The z-score multiplier should be **z = 1.96**, because 95% of the area under the $Z \text{~} N(0, 1)$ normal distribution lies between -1.96 and 1.96.
- **99%**: The z-score multiplier should be **z = 2.575**, because 99% of the area under the $Z \text{~} N(0, 1)$ normal distribution lies between -2.575 and 2.575.

For smaller samples, use the t-statistic, which measures distance from the mean. The difference between the t-statistic and the t-distribution is that the t-statistic determines the distance from the mean by using the standard error rather than the standard deviation of the sample (as the t-distribution uses).
