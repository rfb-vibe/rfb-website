<h2>The Normal Distribution</h2>
<p>The bell curve, the Gaussian curve - a continuous distribution that is symmetrical and its mean, median, and mode are equal. The area under the curve is 1.0</p>
<p>68% of values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean
95% of values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean
99.7% of values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean</p>
<p><strong>The Standard Normal Distribution</strong>
A special case of the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1</p>
<p>Any normal distribution can be converted to a standard normal distribution and vice versa using the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> - divided by </p>
<p>A z-score can help identify how many standard deviations above or below the mean a certain observation is - “above” or “below” the mean</p>
<p><strong>The Central Limit Theorem:</strong> When you add a large number of independent random variables, irrespective of the original distribution of these variables, their sum tends towards a normal distribution.</p>

<div id="confidence-intervals" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>
<p>A confidence interval is a range of values above and below the point estimate that captures the true population parameter at some predetermined confidence level.</p>
<p>If we want our confidence level — i.e., how confident we are that the true value of the parameter lies within the confidence interval — to be:
- <strong>90%</strong>: The z-score multiplier should be <strong>z = 1.645</strong>, because 90% of the area under the <span class="math inline">\(Z \text{~} N(0, 1)\)</span> normal distribution lies between -1.645 and 1.645.
- <strong>95%</strong>: The z-score multiplier should be <strong>z = 1.96</strong>, because 95% of the area under the <span class="math inline">\(Z \text{~} N(0, 1)\)</span> normal distribution lies between -1.96 and 1.96.
- <strong>99%</strong>: The z-score multiplier should be <strong>z = 2.575</strong>, because 99% of the area under the <span class="math inline">\(Z \text{~} N(0, 1)\)</span> normal distribution lies between -2.575 and 2.575.</p>
<p>For smaller samples, use the t-statistic, which measures distance from the mean. The difference between the t-statistic and the t-distribution is that the t-statistic determines the distance from the mean by using the standard error rather than the standard deviation of the sample (as the t-distribution uses).</p>
