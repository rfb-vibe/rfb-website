This post is a compilation of Python code related to sets and probability, including code examples to explore sets, set operations, and partitioning and the law of total probability

## Events Sample Space, and Partitioning
Event: the outcome of an experiment
Sample space: the collection of every single possible outcome

**Independent events:** The occurrence of Event A has not effect on whether or not Event B will occur. Events A and B are independent if:
The probability of the intersection of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B
P($A \cap B$) = $P(A)*P(B)$

The probability of A or B occurring P($A \cup B$) = $P(A)$ + $P(B)$ - P($A \cap B$)

**Disjoint events:** Event A occurring means that Event B cannot occur

**Dependent events:** The occurrence of Event A has an effect on whether or not Event B will occur

Conditional Probability - when the outcome of a trial may influence the result of upcoming trials - the probability of A given B

$P(A \mid B)$ = \frac{P($A \cap B$)}{P(B)}

The probability of A given B is equal to the probability of the intersection of A and B divided by the probability of B.

**Partitioning and the Law of Total Probability**
In general, we can say that for any two events A and B:
$P(A)$ = P($A \cup B$) + P($A \cup B'$)

Thus
$P(A)$ = $P(A \mid B)$$P(B)$ + $P(A \mid B')$$P(B')$)

### Examples:
**Example 1:**
After conducting a survey, one of the outcomes was that 8 out of 10 of the survey subjects liked chocolate chip cookies. If three survey subjects are chosen at random with replacement, what is the probability that all three like chocolate chip cookies?

Probabilities: p_sub1 = p_sub2 = p_sub3
Trials are independent
P(sub1, sub2, sub3 all like chocolate chip cookies) = p_sub1 * p_sub2 * p_sub3

**Example 2:**
70% of your friends like chocolate flavored ice cream, and 35% like chocolate AND like strawberry flavors. What percent of those who like chocolate also like strawberry?

P(Strawberry|Chocolate) = P(Chocolate and Strawberry) / P(Chocolate)
p_strberry_given_choc = 0.35 / 0.7

**Example 3:**
In games where at least one goal is made, a soccer team wins 60% of its games when it scores the first goal, and 10% of its games when the opposing team scores first.

If the team scores the first goal about 30% of the time, what fraction of the games does it win?
```{python, eval=FALSE}
# Let W be the event that the team wins, 

# SF be the event that it scores first. 
# Then according to law of total probs.

# wins given scoring first = P(W/SF) = 60%
# wins given opponent scoring first = P(SFc) = 10%
# team scores first goal = P(SF) = 30%

# P(W) = P(W|SF) · P(SF) + P(W|SFc) · P(SFc)

p_w = (6/10 * 3/10) + (1/10 * 7/10)

```

**Example 4:**
In Europe, except for regular gas, cars often run on diesel as well. At a gas station in Paris; 


* 40% of the customers fill up with diesel (event G1) 
* 35% with gas "Super 95" (event G2)
* 25% with gas "Super 98" (event G3). 


* 30% of the customers who buy diesel fill their tank completely (event F). 
* For "Super 95" and "Super 98", these numbers are  60% and 50%, respectively.


- Compute the probability that the next customer completely fills their tank and buys Super 95. 
- Compute the probability that the next customer completely fills their tank
- Given that the next customer fills their tank completely, compute the probability that they bought diesel. 
```{python, eval=FALSE}

# G1 - diesel = .4
# G2 - super 95 = .35
# G3 - super 98 = .25
# F1 - diesel_full = .3
# F2 - 95_full = .6
# F3 - 98_full = .5

```

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# full tank and super 95
# super 95 = .35
# full super 95 = .6

full_super_95 = 0.35 * 0.6
full_super_95 # correct answer: 0.21

```

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# fills their tank (not knowing what type of fuel) - probability of all options
# full diesel + full 95 + full 98

full_diesel = 0.4 * 0.3
full_super_98 = 0.25 * 0.5

p_full = full_super_95 + full_diesel + full_super_98
p_full # correct answer: 0.455

```

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# full tank, did they buy diesel?
# prob it's diesel = .4
# prob it's full and diesel = .3

p_diesel_given_full = (0.4 * 0.3)/p_full
p_diesel_given_full # correct answer: 0.263736

```
