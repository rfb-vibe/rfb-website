Class notes on statistical tests and hypothesis testing.

## Types of Statistical Tests

* One-Sample $z$-test: used for tests only related to the sample mean. You test whether the average of the sample suggests that the sample values come from a certain population with a known mean or whether it may come from a different population.
* One-Tail Test: When you want to know if a parameter from the treatment group is greater than (or less than) a corresponding parameter in the control group.
* Two-Tail Test: When you want to test if a parameter falls between (or outside of) a range of two given values.
* One sample t-test: compares a mean to a population or hypothesized value
* Independent samples t-test: compares the means of two unrelated groups
    - Dependent variable is continuous
    - Independent variable is categorical with two or more categories
* Dependent/Paired samples t-test: compares the means of two related groups, either the same people were measured twice or people in the sample were related
* ANOVA: statistical method used for comparing means across three or more groups
    - ANOVA is an omnibus test: a significant result indicates that there IS a difference between the means, but is not useful in determining WHICH means are different from each other


### p-values
p-value: The chance of probability. A statistical summary of the compatibility between the observed data and what you would expect to see in a population assuming the statistical model is correct.

If the p-value is lower your determined alpha (for example, \alpha = 0.05), then you reject your null hypothesis; the null hypothesis is not true.

If the p-value is higher than your set alpha, then you fail to reject your null hypothesis; the null hypothesis is true.


### Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between A and B
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between A and B - this is the claim you are trying to prove with an experiment.

**One-Sample z-test example:**
A fast-food chain claims that the mean time to order food at their restaurants is 60 seconds, with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. You decide to put this claim to the test and go to one of the restaurants to observe actual waiting times. You take a sample of 36 customers and find that the mean order time was 75 seconds. Does this finding provide enough evidence to contradict the fast food chain's claim of fast service?
```{python}

# State your null and alternative hypotheses


# H0 : the time to order food is less than or equal to 60 sec
# HA : the time to order food is bigger than 60 seconds


import math
import scipy.stats as stats
mu = 60
sigma = 30
n=36
x_bar = 75
z = (x_bar - mu)/(sigma/math.sqrt(n))
p = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z)

p,z
# p = 0.0013
# z = 3.0

# Interpretation: with p-value less than 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis and say that the time to order food is significantly higher than what the fast food chain claims. 

```
