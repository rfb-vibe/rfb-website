<p>The one-sample z-test is used for tests only related to the sample mean. You test whether the average of the sample suggests that the sample values come from a certain population with a known mean or whether it may come from a different population.</p>
<p>The z-table contains the cumulative probabilities of a standard normal deviation up until a given z-score value. The z-table tells us what percentage is under the curve up to a certain point.</p>
<p>z-scores in <code>scipy</code></p>
<pre class="python"><code># Z-table in Python 
import scipy.stats as stats

# Probabilities up to z-score of 1.5
print(stats.norm.cdf(1.5))
# 0.933

# Probabilities greater than z-score of 1.34
print (1-stats.norm.cdf(1.34))
# 0.09</code></pre>
<p>p-value: The chance of probability. A statistical summary of the compatibility between the observed data and what you would expect to see in a population assuming the statistical model is correct.</p>
<p>If the p-value is lower your determined alpha (for example, = 0.05), then you reject your null hypothesis; the null hypothesis is not true.</p>
<p>If the p-value is higher than your set alpha, then you fail to reject your null hypothesis; the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between A and B
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a relationship between A and B - this is the claim you are trying to prove with an experiment.</p>
<p>One-Tail Test: When you want to know if a parameter from the treatment group is greater than (or less than) a corresponding parameter in the control group.</p>
<p>Two-Tail Test: When you want to test if a parameter falls between (or outside of) a range of two given values.</p>
<p>One-Sample <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test: Best suited for situations where you want to investigate whether a given sample comes from a particular population</p>
<p>Calculate the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-statistic and related probability</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import scipy.stats as stats
from math import sqrt
x_bar = 103 # sample mean 
n = 40 # number of students
sigma = 16 # sd of population
mu = 100 # Population mean 

z = (x_bar - mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
z
# z-statistic = 1.19

stats.norm.cdf(z)
# 0.88 - thus the area under the curve of a z-score of 1.19 is 88%</code></pre>
<p>One-Sample z-test example:</p>
<p>A fast-food chain claims that the mean time to order food at their restaurants is 60 seconds, with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. You decide to put this claim to the test and go to one of the restaurants to observe actual waiting times. You take a sample of 36 customers and find that the mean order time was 75 seconds. Does this finding provide enough evidence to contradict the fast food chainâ€™s claim of fast service?</p>
<pre class="python"><code># State your null and alternative hypotheses


# H0 : the time to order food is less than or equal to 60 sec
# HA : the time to order food is bigger than 60 seconds


import math
import scipy.stats as stats
mu = 60
sigma = 30
n=36
x_bar = 75
z = (x_bar - mu)/(sigma/math.sqrt(n))
p = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z)

p,z
# p = 0.0013
# z = 3.0

# Interpretation: with p-value less than 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis and say that the time to order food is significantly higher than what the fast food chain claims. </code></pre>
