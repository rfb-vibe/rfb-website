The commands and process necessary to use `bash` and `git` to create and maintain Git repositories.

### Bash and Git

**Big Picture Process**

1. Fork a repo from someone else's GitHub to my GitHub
1. Clone from my GitHub to my local machine
1. Do stuff in the repo
1. Push changes to GitHub


**Detailed Process to Fork a Repo**

+ Create a folder on your local machine for where you want the repo to go
+ Navigate to the GitHub repo you want to download
+ Click the **fork** button
+ Copy the URL from your GitHub repo 
+ Return to your bash shell (Terminal on mac)
+ `git clone` + the URL
+ View the files in the current directory with `ls`


**As You Continue Working**

+ Use `git status` to keep track of changes
+ Stage changes to add with `git add`
+ To commit changes to your repo, `git commit -am "Your commit message"` with your commit message indicating what changes are being committed
+ `git push` to sync local code with GitHub
