intro: |
  Currently, I am enrolled in Flatiron School's Data Science Bootcamp to best prepare myself for my career transition into data science.
  I am a driven, inquisitive, and persistent professional. Curiosity, learning, and problem-solving drive my daily work. Asking questions, seeking to understand, and wondering why are my natural defaults.
  With an educational background in the humanities and social sciences, I am adept at asking questions, searching for the necessary (and hopefully accessible) data to find patterns or explanations for the posed questions, and analyzing the story of the data within the scope of the questions.
