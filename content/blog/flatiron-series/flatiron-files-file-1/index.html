<p>This first blogpost will be my notes for the first few lessons of the Flatiron Data Science bootcamp.</p>
<div id="bash-git" class="section level1">
<h1>Bash Git</h1>
<p>Process
1. Fork a repo from someone elseâ€™s GitHub to my GitHub
2. Clone from my GitHub to my local machine
3. Do stuff in the repo
4. Push changes to GitHub</p>
<p>To start:
- Create a folder on your local machine for where you want the repo to go
- Navigate to the GitHub repo you want to download
- Click the <strong>fork</strong> button
- Copy the URL from your GitHub repo
- Return to your bash shell (Terminal on mac)
- <code>git clone</code> + the URL
- View the files in the current directory with <code>ls</code></p>
<p>Moving forward:
- Use <code>git status</code> to keep track of changes
- Stage changes to add with <code>git add</code>
- To commit changes to your repo, <code>git commit -am "Your commit message"</code> with your commit message indicating what changes are being committed
- <code>git push</code> to sync local code with GitHub</p>
