This first blogpost will be my notes for the first few lessons of the Flatiron Data Science bootcamp.

# Bash Git

Process
1. Fork a repo from someone else's GitHub to my GitHub
2. Clone from my GitHub to my local machine
3. Do stuff in the repo
4. Push changes to GitHub

To start:
- Create a folder on your local machine for where you want the repo to go
- Navigate to the GitHub repo you want to download
- Click the **fork** button
- Copy the URL from your GitHub repo 
- Return to your bash shell (Terminal on mac)
- `git clone` + the URL
- View the files in the current directory with `ls`

Moving forward:
- Use `git status` to keep track of changes
- Stage changes to add with `git add`
- To commit changes to your repo, `git commit -am "Your commit message"` with your commit message indicating what changes are being committed
- `git push` to sync local code with GitHub

```{python}



```
