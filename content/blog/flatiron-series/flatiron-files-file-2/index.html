<p>This blogpost is going to summarize the lessons on data analysis in base python and pandas. These lessons and content are from the Flatiron School.</p>
<div id="introduction-to-data-analysis---cumulative-lab" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to Data Analysis - Cumulative Lab</h2>
<p>The objectives of this lab are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice reading serialized JSON and CSV data from files into Python objects</li>
<li>Practice extracting information from nested data structures</li>
<li>Practice cleaning data (filtering, normalizing locations, converting types)</li>
<li>Combine data from multiple sources into a single data structure</li>
<li>Interpret descriptive statistics and data visualizations to present my findings</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-task-to-analyze-the-relationship-between-population-and-mens-world-cup-success" class="section level3">
<h3>The Task: To Analyze the Relationship between Population and Men’s World Cup Success</h3>
<p>Using data from the 2018 Men’s World Cup, we are going to ascertain if any relationship exists between participating countries’ population and success (as measured by cumulative wins).</p>
</div>
<div id="data-understanding" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Understanding</h3>
<p>The data sources for this analysis will be pulled from two separate files.</p>
<p><code>world_cup_2018.json</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Source: This dataset comes from <a href="http://openfootball.github.io/">football.db</a>, a “free and open public domain football database &amp; schema for use in any (programming) language”</li>
<li>Contents: Data about all games in the 2018 World Cup, including date, location (city and stadium), teams, goals scored (and by whom), and tournament group</li>
<li>Format: Nested JSON data (dictionary containing a list of rounds, each of which contains a list of matches, each of which contains information about the teams involved and the points scored)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>country_populations.csv</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Source: This dataset comes from a curated collection by <a href="https://datahub.io/core/population">DataHub.io</a>, originally sourced from the World Bank</li>
<li>Contents: Data about populations by country for all available years from 1960 to 2018</li>
<li>Format: CSV data, where each row contains a country name, a year, and a population</li>
</ul>
<div id="getting-the-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Getting the Data</h4>
<pre class="python"><code>
# Import necessary packages
import json
import csv</code></pre>
<p>Open the relevant files</p>
<pre class="python"><code>
world_cup_file = open(&quot;data/world_cup_2018.json&quot;, encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;)
population_file = open(&quot;data/country_populations.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here, we use the <code>json</code> package to load the data from the <code>world_cup_file</code> into a dictionary (which we’ll use for analysis) called <code>world_cup_data</code> and we’ll use the <code>csv</code> package to to load the data from <code>population_file</code> into a list of dictionaries called <code>population_data</code></p>
<pre class="python"><code>
# Men&#39;s World Cup Data
world_cup_data = json.load(world_cup_file)

# Close the file now that we&#39;re done reading from it
world_cup_file.close()

# Population Data
population_data = list(csv.DictReader(population_file))

# Close the file now that we&#39;re done reading from it
population_file.close()</code></pre>
